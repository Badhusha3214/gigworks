          Cancellation and Refund Policy
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl">
          At <span>GigWork</span>, we strive to provide clear and transparent
          terms regarding our subscription services. Please read the following
          policy carefully before proceeding with your subscription.
        </p>

        <p className="text-xl font-bold py-4">1. Subscription Model</p>
        <p className="text-xl">
          Our directory offers a yearly subscription for businesses to be listed
          on our platform. The subscription process is initiated only after the
          business has provided all necessary details, agreed to our terms and
          conditions, and reviewed the information submitted.
        </p>

        <p className="text-xl font-bold py-4">2. Cancellation Policy</p>
        <p className="text-xl">
          Due to the nature of our service, cancellations are not permitted once
          the subscription process is complete. Payment is processed only after
          you have filled in all required details on our website and agreed to
          the terms. Once payment is made, your business listing is considered
          confirmed, and the subscription is active for one year.
        </p>

        <p className="text-xl font-bold py-4">3. Refund Policy</p>
        <p className="text-xl">
          We do not offer refunds for any reason once a subscription is
          processed. A portion of the payment is allocated to our agents who
          assist in reaching out to businesses on behalf of the company, making
          refunds infeasible.
        </p>

        <p className="text-xl font-bold py-4">4. Non-Refundable Items</p>
        <p className="text-xl">
          There are no specific items or services listed as non-refundable
          because the entire payment made for the subscription is
          non-refundable.
        </p>
